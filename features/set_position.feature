  As a developer
  I want to set an element's position

  Scenario: Update position attribute
    Given an empty fruit model
      And an 'apple' fruit
      And an 'orange' fruit
     When I update the apple's position attribute to 1
     Then the apple is in position 1
      And the orange is in position 0
     Then the ranked fruit array is [orange, apple]

  Scenario: Update position attribute with rank method
    Given an apple
      And an orange
     When I assign the apple's rank to 1
     Then the apple is in position 1
      And the orange is in position 0
     Then the ranked fruit array is [orange, apple]
